        <p className={styles.subtitle}>
          We wanted to make sustainability feel less like a chore and more like a game. 
          Eco-friendly habits are sometimes framed around making a sacrifice or guilt, 
          which can discourage people from doing them. Our inspiration came from the idea 
          of turning small actions into a fun and rewarding experience, like growing a 
          digital garden that reflects your real-world impact.
